# OS Information Enumeration
### What this program does?
This is a C program written by me that does the following:

1. Enumerate all the running processes.
2. List all the running threads within process boundary.
3. Enumerate all the loaded modules within the processes.
4. Is able to show all the executable pages within the processes.
5. Gives us a capability to read the memory.

This program is only executable in Terminal.
